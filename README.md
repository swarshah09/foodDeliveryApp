# Food Delivery System (Microservices)

A full-stack microservices-based Food Delivery platform implementing the provided SRS.

## Stack

- Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Cloud 2023.x
- Services: Eureka Server, API Gateway, User, Restaurant, Order, Payment, Delivery, Notification
- Database: MySQL
- Messaging: Apache Kafka (with Zookeeper)
- Frontend: React (Vite + TypeScript + MUI)
- Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions (sample workflow provided)
- Optional: Kubernetes manifests for production

## Quickstart (Local via Docker Compose)

1) Prerequisites: Docker v24+, Docker Compose v2+, 8GB RAM available
2) Build images:
```bash
docker compose build
```
3) Launch stack:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
4) Access:
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
- Eureka Dashboard: http://localhost:8761
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

See below for service-specific APIs and environment variables. Detailed deployment and Kubernetes guides are included later in this document.

---

## Services (Overview)

- Eureka Server (service discovery)
- API Gateway (routing, auth)
- User Service (JWT auth, roles)
- Restaurant Service (restaurants, menus)
- Order Service (order lifecycle)
- Payment Service (payment simulation)
- Delivery Service (assignment, tracking)
- Notification Service (Kafka consumers)

Each service is a separate Spring Boot application with its own Dockerfile and configuration.

---

## Development

You can run each service locally via your IDE or via Docker. For Docker, build images with `docker compose build` and run `docker compose up -d`.

---

## Deployment

Two options provided:

1) Docker Compose (reference for local/dev)
2) Kubernetes (manifests under `k8s/`) â€“ suitable for production when paired with managed MySQL and Kafka

---

## Security

The API Gateway validates JWTs generated by the User Service. Gateway forwards identity using `X-User-Id` and `X-User-Role` headers to downstream services for authorization decisions.

---

## Status

Initial scaffold. Implementations will be added incrementally across services and frontend.
